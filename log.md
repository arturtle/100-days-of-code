# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Wednesday, January 30, 2019
####Mashable Navbar

**Today's Progress**: replicated navbars, hoping to complete 5 navbars by the end of the week. First one is the [Mashable](https://www.mashable.com) navigation bar. Also learned how to fork, build, & clone repositories in GitHub.

**Thoughts:** Overall it was a good day. I had a hard time adjusting the font size of the logo, two selectors were in conflict in my CSS. I've also been trying to use semantic names for the classes so I can build multiple navbars on the same page.
